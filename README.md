# Amazon Image Renamer

This repository already contains the streamlined workflow introduced in the latest update (centralized filename helpers, simplified tile interactions, and unified download handling). Pull the current `work` branch into your local clone to get the changes immediately. No extra manual steps are required unless you have uncommitted local modifications.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run `npm run build` before distributing a production bundle.
